It was developed in asp.net visual studio, with base HTML5 Boilerplate default template.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUsing the Visual Studio 2010 Express, we can develop the site with a rapid speed. Concept of the Master Pages done all the work. So we just need to fill the content in the pages. Any correction in the common content like menu bar or logo we need not change the data in each and every page, just a simple change in the master page will affect all the change in all the pages.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>Nivo Slider - </strong>Nivo Slider is a Jquery image slider with give a flash like effects in the transitions. It\u2019s my favourite slider, Used it with some images in all the pages.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>Enquiry - </strong>In the enquiry page we have a small enquiry form which directly send a mail to the customer email address. The Visual Studio inbuilt form validation make my work easy, without going for any 3rd party Jquery or Javascript Validation Engines. Just a drag and drop, done!!! \r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>HTML5 Boilerplate -</strong>In lot of my project i will use this base template, it is difficult to start everything from the scratch, HTML5 Boilerplate will provide all the css, js and png fixes which are very common in all the projects.\r\n\t</p>","size":"medium","shortDescription":"","skills":null,"thumbnail":"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/cruxmm/cruxmm_thumb.jpg","banner":"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/cruxmm/cruxmm_banner.jpg","screenshots":" http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/cruxmm/s/cruxmm1.jpg, http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/cruxmm/s/cruxmm2.jpg, http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/cruxmm/s/cruxmm3.jpg","tags":"asp.net,master pages,html,css,javascript","date":"2011-08-20","nextProject":{"_id":{"$oid":"527f4be86265360002050000"},"archived":true,"banner":"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/liveradio_banner.jpg","date":"2011-09-08","description":"\u003Cblockquote\u003E A desktop application built on asp.NET for moksha margamulu to live stream the internet radio that is hosted on primcast and maintained by the Mokshamargamulu team\u003C/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cimg src=\"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/s/liveradio2.png\" data-size=\"[648, 275]\" data-height=\"275px\" data-width=\"648px\"\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cimg src=\"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/s/liveradio3.png\" data-size=\"[648, 275]\" data-height=\"275px\" data-width=\"648px\"\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cimg src=\"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/s/liveradio4.png\" data-size=\"[648, 275]\" data-height=\"275px\" data-width=\"648px\"\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cimg src=\"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/s/liveradio5.png\" data-size=\"[648, 275]\" data-height=\"275px\" data-width=\"648px\"\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cimg src=\"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/s/liveradio6.png\" data-size=\"[648, 275]\" data-height=\"275px\" data-width=\"648px\"\u003E\r\n","isActive":false,"projectUrl":"http://mmliveradio.com/","screenshots":"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/s/liveradio1.png","sequence":21,"shortDescription":"","size":"large","skills":null,"tags_array":["asp.NET","C#","XML"],"thumbnail":"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/liveradio/liveradio_thumb.jpg","title":"MM Live Radio","views":24,"votes":0},"previousProject":{"_id":{"$oid":"527e1f376466640002000000"},"archived":true,"banner":"http://assets-websiddu.appspot.com/images/technofest/technofest_banner.jpg","date":"2010-01-01","description":"\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\nThe official website for technofest`2k10 a national level technical fest organised at VR Siddhartha Engineering College.
